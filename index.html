  <p style="font-size: x-large; background-color: beige;">Thought I would continue my trend of linking all my media arts classes by incorporating a website for my persistent
    project I've been working on, my game Imposter Theory: Crimson Castle. I've already had to make
    illustrations for it in drawing class, an animation from my animation class, a comic from my manga/anime class,
    gameplay update videos from my game studio class, and just the game itself which will eventually
    develop into a full fledged game, and act as a prequel to my senior project game. So this website could act as a
    good culmination of all that work and as a sort of starting point for my eventual game studio portfolio.
